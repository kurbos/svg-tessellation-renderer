# SVG Tessellation Renderer
[![build](https://github.com/kurbos/svg-tessellation-renderer/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kurbos/svg-tessellation-renderer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A tessellation-based renderer for SVG files. The renderer uploads a tessellation to the GPU and renders from a GPU storage buffer offering inexpensive redraw for affine transformations.

You may need some know-how or troubleshooting skills to work with this crate at the moment.
